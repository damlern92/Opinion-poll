# Opinion-poll
In this PHP project, I've created an opinion poll application.

The opinion poll will consist of 3 major components:
- Front controller - this is the index page that will determine the HTML code to be loaded
- Business Logic -  this will contain the PHP code for interacting with the database
- Views -  this will contain the HTML code. I will have two pages namely:
opinion.html.php – this will contain the HTML code with the question and options,
results.html.php – this will contain the HTML code that displays the opinion poll results

The opinion poll will ask the question –
What is your favorite PHP Framework?

Answers would be:
Laravel
Codeigniter
Symfony
CakePHP
Yii
